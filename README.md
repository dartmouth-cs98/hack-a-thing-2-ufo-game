Hack a Thing 2

I built a game in Unity. The user can controll a UFO to collect a bunch of rotating asteriods that are randomly
placed around the game field. The user wins the game when all 11 asteriods are caught.

I followed a tutorial on the Unity website:
https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-ufo-tutorial

I worked on my own and learned how to connect scripts to the game objects. I learned about the camera, players, and board game layers. I think Unity is a good tool for 2D and 3D games, and I'm interested in creating a game for my 98 project. This could also relate to my Digital Arts work, because I know how to model in Maya. It would be cool to create something in Maya and have that be in object in a Unity game. 

I thought the tutorial was pretty straightforward and easy to follow, so I didn't have too many issues.
