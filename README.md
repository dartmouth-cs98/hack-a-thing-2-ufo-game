##Hack a Thing 2
I built a game in Unity. The user can controll a UFO to collect a bunch of rotating asteriods that are randomly
placed around the game field.

I followed a tutorial on the Unity website:
https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-ufo-tutorial

I worked on my own and learned how to write scripts
